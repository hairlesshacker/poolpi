# poolpi
pete's pool control app

perhaps someday I'll write a real readme.  code first, document never.

use a raspberry pi zero-W with an 8-relay board to control pool settings...
 - SpringBoot/Thymeleaf
 - SSE for udpating temp reading
---------------------------
 - using with 24VAC class-2 transformer to control valves, heater, and larger contactor relays.
 - contactors control 240VAC current for Booster Pump Motor and Spa Blower
 - using 2 relays to control Hayward multi-speed pump in relay-remote mode.
 - using DS18B20 Temp sensor to monitor water temp on return line.
